# PHP-Learning

This content is derived from the PHP Practicioner series in [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/). It is for a school project called Coffee Club.

The repo is far from a complete application but it contains enough to get students started with a super rudimentary framework. 

The `database/sql/create-coffee.sql` file contains login information to get you started. Students will want to change this to protect their data. After changing it, you will need to update your `config.php` file for the application to connect to the database.
